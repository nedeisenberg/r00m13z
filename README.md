# r00m13z

INTRODUCTION
R00M13Z is a web based, single player game set in a modern day New York City apartment. The object of the game is to maintain harmony between yourself and your roommates, Fran and Deb. Fran is a single cat lady in her 30s from Minnesota while Deb is a gardener who grows her, uhm, plants in the apartment.
Tensions experienced by you and your roommates is displayed in meters at the top of the page. Random occurences or annoying roommates can cause tension spikes, which can be alleviated by certain purchases.
Along the way, you encounter everything from ghosts to police raids. Can you survive the apartment?



GETTING STARTED
After opening the game in your browser, you will be presented with a calendar which represents your life and day to day chores. You receive a salary every two weeks and your rent is automatically deducted but when it comes to chores and unexpected events, it's up to you to figure it out.

You can use your funds to purchase tools, pets and plants found in the menu. Pets and plants can be purchased to alleviate your task load meter and tools will help lessen repair costs.
